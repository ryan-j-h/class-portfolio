# Portfolio of Class Coding Assignments

This repository hosts code written by Ryan Hastings (sometimes with a partner) 
for class assignments.

The classes include
* STA 210: Regression Analysis (`reg`)
* STA 323: Statistical Programming (`progr`)
* STA 360: Bayesian and Modern Statistics (`bayes`)

# Details

`bayes-mvnormal-missingdata.Rmd` and `bayes-regress-modelselect.Rmd` are individual homework assignments from STA 360. Topics include Gibbs sampling, Bayesian regression and model selection, missing data, and the multivariate normal distribution.

`reg-logit.Rmd` and `reg-multinomial logit.Rmd` are individual homework assignments from STA 210. They include exploratory data analysis, checking model assumptions, hypothesis testing, and interpreting results for logistic and multinomial logistic regression.

`progr-oop-polynomials.Rmd` and `progr-scraping/` are partner homework assignments from STA 323. The former file creates a class of polynomials using `R`'s `S3` object-oriented programming environment. The latter directory contains a web scraping and spatial data visualization assignment. More information is available in the directory's `README.md` file.
