# Sheetz Stores

## Scraping Methods
 
To get data about each Sheetz location, we first scraped the homepage for links 
to each region of Sheetz stores, filtering out any phony links. We created a 
function to scrape information for all stores in a given section; this function 
read a section page in JSON format and converted it to a list, defined a helper 
function to convert an individual store's list to a row, and then constructed a 
dataframe of all stores in a section. We ran this code for all ten sections.

To parse the data, we cleaned the names of the variables, selected variables we 
wanted to use or display (store number, address, city, state, latitude, and 
longitude) and converted the data to a simple features object.

## Data

Here are the addresses of all the Sheetz stores in Pennsylvania.

```{r sheetz_logo, out.width = "200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sheetz-logo.png")
```

```{r preview_sheetz}
datatable(sheetz, 
          rownames = FALSE, 
          filter="top", 
          options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T) )
```


# Wawa Stores

## Scraping Methods
The wawa stores dataset was scraped as if it came from a web API using the 
JSON lite package. The steps we took consisted of first running a function that 
scraped the potential web pages into a list then converting it into a dataframe. 
We used the safely function to deal with the potential pages that did not have a 
Wawa store. 

## Data

Here are the addresses of all the Wawa stores in Pennsylvania.


<br>


```{r wawa logo, out.width = "200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/wawa-logo.png")
```
<br><br>

```{r wawa}
datatable(wawa, 
          rownames = FALSE, 
          filter="top", 
          options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T) )
```


# Turf War

## Overview

Here is a map of all the Sheetz and Wawa stores in Pennsylvania.

<br>

```{r create_layers}
sheetz_map   <- mapview(sheetz, col.regions = "#FF3333",
                        label = str_c(sheetz$address , ", ", sheetz$city),
                        layer.name = "Sheetz")

wawa_map     <- mapview(wawa, col.regions = "#FFC300",
                        label = str_c(wawa$address, ", ", wawa$city),
                        layer.name = "Wawa")

counties_map <- mapview(counties, col.region = "#000000", 
                        alpha = 0.5, alpha.fill = 0.05, 
                        label = counties$county_nam, 
                        layer.name = "Counties")
```

<center>
```{r display_map}
counties_map + sheetz_map + wawa_map
```
</center>

## Contested Territory

We classify counties, calling contested any county that contains both a Sheetz 
and a Wawa.

<center>
```{r classify_counties}
contested_counties <- counties[sheetz, ] %>%
                        .[wawa, ]

sheetz_counties    <- counties[sheetz, ] %>% 
                        filter(!(county_nam %in% contested_counties$county_nam))

wawa_counties      <- counties[wawa,] %>% 
                        filter(!(county_nam %in% contested_counties$county_nam))

contested_sheetz   <- sheetz[contested_counties, ]

contested_wawa     <- wawa[contested_counties, ]

sheetz_counties_map    <- mapview(sheetz_counties, col.region = "#FF3333", 
                            alpha = 0.5, alpha.fill = 0.2, 
                            label = sheetz_counties$county_nam, 
                            layer.name = "Sheetz Counties")

wawa_counties_map      <- mapview(wawa_counties, col.region = "#FFC300", 
                            alpha = 0.5, alpha.fill = 0.2, 
                            label = wawa_counties$county_nam, 
                            layer.name = "Wawa Counties")

contested_counties_map <- mapview(contested_counties, col.region = "blue", 
                            alpha = 0.5, alpha.fill = 0.2, 
                            label = contested_counties$county_nam, 
                            layer.name = "Contested Counties")

contested_sheetz_map   <- mapview(contested_sheetz, col.region = "#FF3333",
                            label = str_c(contested_sheetz$address, ", ", 
                                          contested_sheetz$city),
                            layer.name = "Contested Sheetz")

contested_wawa_map     <- mapview(contested_wawa, col.region = "#FFC300",
                            label = str_c(contested_wawa$address, ", ", 
                                          contested_wawa$city),
                            layer.name = "Contested Wawas")

sheetz_counties_map + wawa_counties_map + contested_counties_map +
  contested_sheetz_map + contested_wawa_map
```

The counties that contain both Sheetz and Wawa are Lancaster, Berks, Lehigh and 
Northampton. Lancaster and Berks counties are truly contested, as there are 
several Sheetz and several Wawas. This is where the turf war converges. Lehigh 
and Northampton counties, however, are really part of Wawa territory with a few
Sheetz infiltrators, as they contain two or fewer Sheetz, and Carbon and Monroe 
counties to the north are Wawa counties.

Thus, the two brands are not completely inseparable, but there appears to be a 
division of territories of the two gas station brands in Pennsylvania. Wawa 
is predominant in the southeastern portion of the state, in the Philadelphia 
metropolitan area and its suburbs. Sheetz is more prominent throughout the rest
of the state. Thus divisions in the two companies can be visually identified in 
the state of Pennsylvania.
